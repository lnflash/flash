# API Key Management System Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the roadmap for implementing the API key management system in the context of the Flash project. It provides a structured approach for integrating this feature while considering the current development focus.

## Current Branch Context: feat/cashout-notify

The current branch appears to be focused on adding notification capabilities for cashout operations. This feature is complementary to our API key management system, as it represents the kind of functionality that third-party developers might want to access via API.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current Work)

**Status: In Progress**

- ✅ Design API key management system architecture
- ✅ Document implementation plan (API_KEY_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- ✅ Set up AZ-RSP methodology (ABSOLUTE_ZERO_METHOD.md)
- ✅ Create verifiable environment for testing
- ✅ Implement first enhancement: Adaptive Rate Limiting
- ✅ Document implementation example (IMPLEMENTATION_EXAMPLE.md)
- ✅ Summarize progress (AZ_RSP_SUMMARY.md)

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

**Timeline: 2-3 Weeks**

1. **Database Schema**
   - Create Mongoose schema for API keys
   - Implement database migration
   - Add indexes for performance

2. **API Key Service**
   - Implement key generation with secure randomness
   - Create key hashing and verification with timing-safe comparison
   - Build scope validation logic
   - Add key lifecycle management (create, update, revoke)

3. **Authentication Middleware**
   - Create Express middleware for API key validation
   - Implement header and query parameter extraction
   - Add caching for performance optimization
   - Integrate with rate limiting service

4. **GraphQL Integration**
   - Add resolvers for API key management
   - Implement GraphQL Shield rules for authorization
   - Create directive for scope-based permission checks

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for end-to-end flows
   - Performance testing for middleware

### Phase 3: Integration with Cashout Notifications

**Timeline: 1-2 Weeks**

1. **Notification Scopes**
   - Create specific scopes for cashout notifications
   - Implement authorization checks in notification resolvers

2. **Webhook Support**
   - Add webhook registration for API key holders
   - Implement webhook delivery for cashout events
   - Add retry logic and delivery tracking

3. **Testing**
   - End-to-end tests for notification delivery
   - Load testing for concurrent notifications

### Phase 4: Developer Experience

**Timeline: 2-3 Weeks**

1. **Dashboard**
   - Create admin UI for API key management
   - Implement developer-facing UI for key management
   - Add usage statistics and visualization

2. **Documentation**
   - Write API documentation
   - Create usage examples
   - Document security best practices

3. **Client Libraries**
   - Create client library for JavaScript/TypeScript
   - Add examples for common use cases

### Phase 5: Advanced Features

**Timeline: 3-4 Weeks**

1. **Key Rotation**
   - Implement zero-downtime key rotation
   - Add automatic expiration and rotation reminders
   - Create emergency revocation capability

2. **Usage Analytics**
   - Implement detailed usage tracking
   - Create analytics dashboard
   - Add alerting for unusual patterns

3. **Quotas**
   - Implement usage quotas by operation type
   - Add configurable quota management
   - Create quota enforcement

## Integration Strategy

### Branching Strategy

1. **Current Work**
   - Continue development on the `az-rsp` branch for foundation work
   - Keep changes isolated from the `feat/cashout-notify` branch

2. **Feature Branch**
   - Create a new `feat/api-key-management` branch from `main`
   - Implement core API key functionality on this branch

3. **Integration**
   - After both `feat/cashout-notify` and `feat/api-key-management` are merged to `main`
   - Create an integration branch to add API key support to cashout notifications

### Code Organization

The API key management system should be organized as follows:

```
src/
  domain/
    api-keys/
      index.ts              # Domain exports
      index.types.d.ts      # Type definitions
      errors.ts             # Domain-specific errors
      primitives.ts         # Domain primitives
      api-key-validator.ts  # Validation logic
      scope-validator.ts    # Scope validation logic
  
  services/
    api-keys/
      index.ts              # Service exports
      index.types.d.ts      # Type definitions
      api-key-service.ts    # Core service implementation
      schema.ts             # Mongoose schema
      
    rate-limit/
      index.ts              # Already implemented
      adaptive-rate-limiter.ts  # Already implemented
      
  servers/
    middlewares/
      api-key-auth.ts       # Authentication middleware
      adaptive-rate-limit.ts  # Already implemented
      
  graphql/
    admin/
      mutations.ts          # Admin API key management
      
    public/
      types/
        api-key.ts          # GraphQL type definitions
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test each component in isolation
   - Use mocks for dependencies
   - Focus on boundary conditions and error handling

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test API key functionality with real database
   - Verify GraphQL resolver behavior
   - Test rate limiting functionality

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test complete API key workflows
   - Verify authentication and authorization
   - Test with real GraphQL queries

4. **Performance Tests**
   - Measure authentication middleware overhead
   - Test rate limiting under load
   - Verify caching effectiveness

## Security Considerations

1. **Key Storage**
   - Store only hashed keys in database
   - Use secure hashing algorithm (Argon2id or similar)
   - Implement proper key revocation

2. **Access Control**
   - Restrict API key management to administrators
   - Implement principle of least privilege for scopes
   - Audit all key management operations

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Apply rate limiting to all API key authentication attempts
   - Implement exponential backoff for failed attempts
   - Monitor for suspicious activity

4. **Audit Logging**
   - Log all key lifecycle events
   - Track usage patterns
   - Implement alerting for unusual activity

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to implementing the API key management system in the context of the Flash project. By following this plan, we can ensure that the implementation is secure, performant, and well-integrated with the existing codebase.

The AZ-RSP methodology will continue to be applied for enhancing the system, as demonstrated by our implementation of adaptive rate limiting and the planned implementation of key rotation.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the current phase by finalizing documentation
2. Coordinate with the team to determine the appropriate timing for beginning Phase 2
3. Create the `feat/api-key-management` branch when ready to begin implementation
