# API Key Enhancement Task: Implement Adaptive Rate Limiting

## Task Category
PERFORMANCE

## Description
Implement an adaptive rate limiting system for API keys that automatically adjusts limits based on usage patterns and suspicious activity detection. The current system uses fixed tiers (DEFAULT, PREMIUM, ENTERPRISE, UNLIMITED) with static rate limits, which doesn't account for varying usage patterns or potential abuse.

## Difficulty
4 (on a scale of 1-5)

## Validation Criteria
1. Must maintain backward compatibility with existing rate limiting tiers
2. Must track historical usage patterns over configurable time windows (hour/day/week)
3. Must identify suspicious activity patterns (sudden spikes, unusual hours, etc.)
4. Must implement gradual rate limit adjustments with configurable sensitivity
5. Must provide a mechanism to temporarily throttle suspicious activity
6. Must include comprehensive logging for transparency and auditing
7. Must ensure performance overhead is minimal (< 5ms per request)
8. Must include unit tests demonstrating the adaptive behavior

## Input/Output Types
- Input: `{ keyId: string, tier: string, operation: string, timestamp: Date }`
- Output: `{ limited: boolean, remainingPoints: number, nextRefreshTime: Date, adaptiveAction?: "throttled" | "increased" | "decreased" | null }`

## Expected Benefits
1. More efficient resource allocation for API users
2. Better protection against DoS or abuse attempts
3. Improved user experience for well-behaved clients
4. Reduced manual intervention for rate limit adjustments
5. More granular visibility into API usage patterns

## Implementation Constraints
1. Must build on top of existing `RateLimiterRedis` implementation
2. Must use Redis for distributed state management
3. Must not add more than one Redis operation per request in the standard flow
4. Should leverage background processing for pattern analysis
5. Must handle Redis failures gracefully

## Testing Scenarios
1. Normal usage should not trigger adaptive limits
2. Sudden burst of requests should trigger temporary throttling
3. Consistent high usage within limits should gradually increase allowance
4. Suspicious patterns (e.g., distributed requests from many IPs) should trigger throttling
5. System should recover normal limits after suspicious activity subsides

## Success Metrics
1. Average API response time impact < 5ms
2. False positive rate for throttling < 1%
3. Detection rate for actual abuse attempts > 95%
4. Reduction in manual rate limit adjustment tickets by 80%
