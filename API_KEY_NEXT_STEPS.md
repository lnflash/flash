- [ ] Add automated response to certain events

### Documentation for Operations
- [ ] Create runbooks for key management
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Document backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Create security incident response plan

## 7. Client Libraries

### JavaScript/TypeScript SDK
- [ ] Create client library for API key usage
- [ ] Implement automatic retry with backoff
- [ ] Add helper functions for common operations
- [ ] Create examples for React, Node.js, etc.

### Other Language SDKs
- [ ] Build Python client library
- [ ] Create Ruby client library
- [ ] Implement Java/Kotlin SDK
- [ ] Add examples for each language

## Priority Order

Given resource constraints, here is the recommended implementation order:

1. **Testing Infrastructure**: Ensure the existing implementation is robust
2. **Documentation**: Enable developers to use the current implementation
3. **Basic Admin UI**: Provide management capability for API keys
4. **Enhanced Security Features**: Improve security of the implementation
5. **Advanced Features**: Add capabilities that enhance the user experience
6. **Client Libraries**: Make integration easier for developers

## Conclusion

The API key management system has made significant progress, with the core functionality already implemented and working correctly. By following the steps outlined in this document, the Flash team can build on this foundation to create a robust, secure, and developer-friendly API ecosystem.

Each of these enhancements can be approached using the AZ-RSP methodology already established, creating tasks that can be implemented and verified independently.
