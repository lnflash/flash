### TLDR

Flash is an opinionated bitcoin banking platform forked from Galoy.

This repo represents the main api that brings all functionality together.
Take a look at the [Quickstart](./quickstart) if you want to take it for a spin.

### Responsible disclosure 

Found critical bugs/vulnerabilities?
Please email them security@galoy.io Thanks!

### Get Started

Want to try it out and contribute? Checkout the [dev documentation](./DEV.md) to deploy locally with a docker compose script.

  - OAuth integration (in progress)
  - Account scoped API keys with comprehensive management system
- Internal ledger:
  - Records all account activity via double entry accounting
  - Support for integrating fiat currencies (in progress)
  - CSV based export of all accounting data

### API Key Management System

Flash includes a comprehensive API key management system that enables third-party developers to securely access the GraphQL API. This system provides fine-grained control over permissions and implements advanced security features.

#### Key Features

- **Secure Key Generation**: Cryptographically secure, randomly generated API keys with prefixes for key type identification
- **Scope-Based Permissions**: Granular access control with customizable scopes for different API operations
- **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Intelligent rate limiting that adjusts based on usage patterns and detects suspicious activity
- **Zero-Downtime Key Rotation**: Seamless key rotation with configurable transition periods
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed audit logs for all API key operations and usage
- **Developer Dashboard**: Self-service portal for developers to manage their API keys

#### Usage Instructions

##### Obtaining an API Key

API keys can be obtained through the developer dashboard or by contacting the Flash administrators. Each key is associated with specific scopes that determine the allowed operations.

##### Authentication

To authenticate API requests, include the API key in the HTTP Authorization header:

```
Authorization: ApiKey flash_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Alternatively, you can pass the API key as a query parameter (less secure):

```
https://api.flash.com/graphql?apiKey=flash_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

##### Making GraphQL Requests

Once authenticated, you can make GraphQL requests to the API. The available operations are determined by the scopes associated with your API key.

Example GraphQL query:

```graphql
query GetWalletBalance {
  me {
    defaultAccount {
      wallets {
        id
        balance
        currency
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Requests are subject to rate limits based on your API key's tier and usage patterns.

##### Understanding Rate Limits

The API employs adaptive rate limiting that adjusts based on usage patterns. The following headers are included in API responses:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum number of requests allowed in the current period
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Number of requests remaining in the current period
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit resets (Unix timestamp)
- `X-RateLimit-Used`: Number of requests made in the current period

If you exceed your rate limit, you'll receive a 429 (Too Many Requests) response.

##### Key Rotation

For security purposes, API keys should be rotated regularly. The API key management system supports zero-downtime key rotation:

1. Generate a new API key through the developer dashboard
2. Update your applications to use the new key
3. Once all systems are updated, revoke the old key

During the transition period, both the old and new keys will work, ensuring continuous operation.

##### Webhook Authentication

When configuring webhooks, the API key system provides a secure mechanism for authenticating callbacks:

1. Each webhook request includes a signature in the `X-Flash-Signature` header
2. The signature is an HMAC-SHA256 hash of the request payload using your API key's secret
3. Verify this signature in your webhook handler to ensure the request is authentic

See [API_KEY_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./API_KEY_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for detailed implementation information.
