# Cashier Role Implementation

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of the Cashier Role feature for the Flash Bitcoin Banking Platform. The feature extends the existing authentication system to support role-based access control (RBAC) for cashier operations.

## Technical Stack
- Backend: Node.js with TypeScript
- API: GraphQL (Apollo Server)
- Databases: MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL
- Authentication: JWT-based with Kratos/Oathkeeper
- Bitcoin Integration: LND, Bitcoin Core

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Foundation âœ… In Progress
- [ ] Analyze existing authentication and role system
- [ ] Design cashier role permissions and access control schema
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC) middleware

### Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] Add cashier-specific GraphQL queries for viewing data
- [ ] Implement cashier transaction logging and audit trail
- [ ] Add cashier role management to admin interface
- [ ] Extend existing API endpoints with cashier permissions

### Phase 3: Enhancement & Polish
- [ ] Implement cashier session management with Redis
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for cashier role functionality
- [ ] Update API documentation for cashier endpoints

## Architecture Decisions
- Extend existing JWT authentication system
- Use MongoDB for role storage and persistence
- Implement audit logging in PostgreSQL for compliance
- Redis for session management and caching

## Security Considerations
- All cashier actions must be logged with timestamps
- Implement principle of least privilege
- Add rate limiting for cashier operations
- Ensure secure token handling and session management
